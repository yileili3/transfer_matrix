# Transfer matrix

Transfer matrix is a MATLAB library for optical analysis of thin films. 

* **Optial modeling:** Transfer matrices is used to model the optics of thin films. Reflectance, transmittance, and absorption can be calculated. 
* **Multi-layer analysis:** The analysis of multi-layer structures, including the presence of substrate and superstrate, can be easily implemented by the multiplication of individual matrices.
* **Deriving dielectric function and refractive index:** A fitting procedure can be used with the transfer matrix to derive the material optical functions including the dielectric function and refractive index.
